// This is the Edge Chat Demo Worker, built using Durable Objects!

// ===============================
// Introduction to Modules
// ===============================
//
// The first thing you might notice, if you are familiar with the Workers platform, is that this
// Worker is written differently from others you may have seen. It even has a different file
// extension. The `mjs` extension means this JavaScript is an ES Module, which, among other things,
// means it has imports and exports. Unlike other Workers, this code doesn't use
// `addEventListener("fetch", handler)` to register its main HTTP handler; instead, it _exports_
// a handler, as we'll see below.
//
// This is a new way of writing Workers that we expect to introduce more broadly in the future. We
// like this syntax because it is *composable*: You can take two workers written this way and
// merge them into one worker, by importing the two Workers' exported handlers yourself, and then
// exporting a new handler that call into the other Workers as appropriate.
//
// This new syntax is required when using Durable Objects, because your Durable Objects are
// implemented by classes, and those classes need to be exported. The new syntax can be used for
// writing regular Workers (without Durable Objects) too, but for now, you must be in the Durable
// Objects beta to be able to use the new syntax, while we work out the quirks.
//
// To see an example configuration for uploading module-based Workers, check out the wrangler.toml
// file or one of our Durable Object templates for Wrangler:
//   * https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-template
//   * https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-rollup-esm
//   * https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-webpack-commonjs

// ===============================
// Required Environment
// ===============================
//
// This worker, when deployed, must be configured with two environment bindings:
// * rooms: A Durable Object namespace binding mapped to the ChatRoom class.
// * limiters: A Durable Object namespace binding mapped to the RateLimiter class.
//
// Incidentally, in pre-modules Workers syntax, "bindings" (like KV bindings, secrets, etc.)
// appeared in your script as global variables, but in the new modules syntax, this is no longer
// the case. Instead, bindings are now delivered in an "environment object" when an event handler
// (or Durable Object class constructor) is called. Look for the variable `env` below.
//
// We made this change, again, for composability: The global scope is global, but if you want to
// call into existing code that has different environment requirements, then you need to be able
// to pass the environment as a parameter instead.
//
// Once again, see the wrangler.toml file to understand how the environment is configured.

// =======================================================================================
// The regular Worker part...
//
// This section of the code implements a normal Worker that receives HTTP requests from external
// clients. This part is stateless.

// With the introduction of modules, we're experimenting with allowing text/data blobs to be
// uploaded and exposed as synthetic modules. By suffixing `chat.html.bin` with ".bin", Wrangler
// knows to interpret the file as a module of type `application/octet-stream`, i.e. just a byte blob.
// So when we import it as `HTML` here, we get the HTML content as an `ArrayBuffer`. So, we can
// serve our app's static asset without relying on any separate storage. (However, the space
// available for assets served this way is very limited; larger sites should continue to use Workers
// KV to serve assets.)
// import HTML from "chat.html.bin";
import {handleErrors} from "./util";
import {EnvInterface} from "./types";

export { ChatRoom } from "./chat-room"
export { RateLimiter } from "./rate-limiter"

// import { getAssetFromKV, mapRequestToAsset } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'

const HTML = 'Hello world';

// addEventListener('fetch', event => {
//   try {
//     event.respondWith(new Response('Hi world', {
//       status: 200,
//     }))
//   } catch (e) {
//     event.respondWith(new Response('Internal Error', { status: 500 }))
//   }
// })

// In modules-syntax workers, we use `export default` to export our script's main event handlers.
// Here, we export one handler, `fetch`, for receiving HTTP requests. In pre-modules workers, the
// fetch handler was registered using `addEventHandler("fetch", event => { ... })`; this is just
// new syntax for essentially the same thing.
//
// `fetch` isn't the only handler. If your worker runs on a Cron schedule, it will receive calls
// to a handler named `scheduled`, which should be exported here in a similar way. We will be
// adding other handlers for other types of events over time.

          // unique ID for this namespace. Each durable object namespace has its own ID space, but
          // IDs from one namespace are not valid for any other.

          // a performance benefit over IDs generated from names: When a unique ID is generated,
          // the system knows it is unique without having to communicate with the rest of the
          // world -- i.e., there is no way that someone in the UK and someone in New Zealand
